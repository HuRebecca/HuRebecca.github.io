                <h1 class="w3-xxlarge">Classifying General Work Activities for ORS Data</h1> 
                <p class="w3-large"> Summer 2019 I worked as a Data Science Fellow at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
                    under the Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. My project was a multiclass, multilabel
                    NLP classification task in which I used text data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) 
                    to broadly classify work activities from the Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS). 
                    The purpose of this work is to eventually gain insight into what kinds of jobs are at risk of 
                    being automated or moved overseas. For this project I used a variety of Python libraries including 
                    Pandas, Numpy, SK-Learn, NLTK, SpaCy. I also played around with some deep learning techniques using
                    Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The code for this project is unavailable as the data is proprietary, 
                    however a brief PowerPoint summarizing the project can be found

                <h1>Microbiome Metadata Normalization</h1> 
                <p class="w3-large">In 2017, IBM and UC San Diego's Center for Microbiome Innovation (CMI)
                    teamed up to form the Artificial Intelligence for Healthy Living Center which focuses on 
                    conducting groundbreaking research in aging and the human microbiome. Last year, I started 
                    working with novel data sets in CMI, normalizing microbiome metadata with Python Pandas in 
                    Jupyter Notebooks. Now, I'm working with two teams at CMI to create 
                    <a href='https://qiime2.org/' target="_blank"> QIIME 2</a> 
                    plugins to download EBI studies and normalize study metadata. 
                    My favorite part of this research is being able gain hands-on experience working with real, messy
                    data in a specialized field like microbiology. I have great mentors and co-researchers at CMI 
                    who encourage me to exercise new skills in developing open-source packages and writing optimized code.
                    Both the EBI downloader and the normalization plugin projects are currently 
                    in early development stages; git repos are avilable

                <p class="w3-large">
                    After attending a talk 
                    <a href='http://www.margaretroberts.net/' target='_blank'>Dr. Margaret Roberts</a> 
                    gave about censorship in China last year, I was super excited to reach out to her and 
                    learn more about her research. I started working for Professor Roberts with my classmate,
                    Emily Zhao, using different NLP techniques to parse and analyze chinese legal documents. 
                    I'm currently working with post doctoral fellow 
                    <a href="https://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/the_team/" target = '_blank'>Young Yang</a> to
                    grab congress members' tweets with the Twitter API, and measure their sentiment towards
                    China based on different events like the Chinese-American trade war or the Hong Kong protests.
                    My favorite part about working with Dr. Roberts is always getting to work on something 
                    different, exercising skills in various aspects of data science, and knowing that 
                    what we're studying is relevent to actual events happening in real time.

                    This was a final project I created for DSC 106: Intro to Data Visualization. 
                    The prompt was to tell a story with data viz, so I chose to tell the story of the banana,
                    and the importance of biodiversity. I grabbed, cleaned, and organized the data with Python 
                    in a Jupyter Notebook, then created the website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Highcharts, 
                    Google Maps API, and Canva. Code for this project is available

                <h1 class="w3-xxlarge">Optimizing Nutrition Under Budgetary Constraints</h1> 
                <p class="w3-large">
                    In 2018, a team of my data science classmates and I were awarded Haligioglu Data Science 
                    Institute fellowships to pursue data science-related projects.
                    We initially tried to address the issue of food insecurity in 
                    underserved communities, and the project we ended up with was a webapp that used 
                    linear optimization to produce nutritionally-optimal grocery lists with user-specified 
                    budget constraints. At the end of our fellowship term, we determined we 
                    needed to understand which macronutrients and micronutrients should be prioritized in 
                    an individual's diet, which is ultimately a nutrition science problem. The final product was 
                    not able to provided grocery lists that were as specialized as we initially intended, but 
                    each of us learned a lot about the process of seeing a data science project from the early
                    stages of brainstorming to a completed product.
